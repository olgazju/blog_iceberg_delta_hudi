# Three Formats Walk into a Lakehouse: Iceberg, Delta and Hudi in a Local Setup You Can Run on Your Laptop

This repository demonstrates a local lakehouse setup using Docker Compose that allows you to experiment with three popular lakehouse table formats: **Apache Iceberg**, **Delta Lake**, and **Apache Hudi**. All running locally on your laptop!

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The setup includes:
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for data lake storage
- **Jupyter Lab**: Interactive environment with PySpark for running lakehouse demos
- **Sample Data**: NYC Yellow Taxi trip data for realistic examples

## üìã Prerequisites

### macOS
1. **Docker Desktop**: Download and install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Ensure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding

### Linux
1. **Docker**: Install Docker Engine
2. **Docker Compose**: Install Docker Compose plugin

### Windows
1. **Docker Desktop**: Download and install with WSL2 backend
2. Ensure WSL2 is properly configured

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/olgazju/blog_iceberg_delta_hudi.git
   cd blog_iceberg_delta_hudi
   ```

2. **Navigate to the common directory**
   ```bash
   cd common
   ```

3. **Start the services**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This command will:
   - Pull the required Docker images
   - Start MinIO object storage
   - Create an S3 bucket and upload sample data
   - Start Jupyter Lab with PySpark

4. **Wait for services to be ready** (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

## üîó Access Points

Once the services are running, you can access:

### Jupyter Lab
- **URL**: http://localhost:8888/
- **Purpose**: Interactive notebooks for lakehouse format demos
- **Features**: 
  - PySpark 3.5.3 pre-configured
  - Access to all three lakehouse format libraries
  - Sample notebooks ready to run

### MinIO Console
- **URL**: http://localhost:9001/browser/my-bucket
- **Login**: 
  - Username: `minioadmin`
  - Password: `minioadmin`
- **Purpose**: Browse and manage your data lake files
- **Pre-loaded Data**: NYC taxi trip data in `raw-files/` folder


## üìì Demo Notebooks

The setup includes three comprehensive notebooks located in the `work/` directory:

### 1. `iceberg.ipynb` - Apache Iceberg Demo

### 2. `delta.ipynb` - Delta Lake Demo

### 3. `hudi.ipynb` - Apache Hudi Demo

## üóÇÔ∏è Sample Data

The setup automatically loads NYC Yellow Taxi trip data:
- `yellow_tripdata_2025-05.parquet`
- `yellow_tripdata_2025-06.parquet`

This realistic dataset allows you to explore:
- Large-scale data processing
- Partitioning strategies
- Query performance optimization
- Real-world lakehouse scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
# Check if ports are already in use
docker compose ps
lsof -i :8888 -i :9000 -i :9001

# Restart services
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Can't access Jupyter
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Check that port 8888 isn't used by another application
3. Wait a few minutes for services to fully initialize
4. Check logs: `docker compose logs jupyter`

### MinIO bucket not accessible
1. Verify MinIO is healthy: `docker compose logs minio`
2. Check if AWS CLI container completed successfully: `docker compose logs aws`
3. Restart if needed: `docker compose restart`

### Jupyter notebooks can't connect to MinIO
1. Ensure all services are running: `docker compose ps`
2. The containers communicate via Docker network, so use `minio:9000` as endpoint in notebooks
3. Restart the entire stack if needed: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

## üßπ Cleanup

To stop and remove all services:
```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Remove volumes (this will delete all data)
docker compose down -v

# Remove images (optional)
docker compose down --rmi all
```

## üìñ Next Steps

1. Start with any of the three notebooks
2. Experiment with the sample data
3. Try modifying the code to explore different features
4. Compare the performance and capabilities of each format
5. Build your own lakehouse experiments!
